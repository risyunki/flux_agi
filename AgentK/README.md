The autoagentic AGI. AgentK is a self-evolving AGI made of agents that collaborate, and build new agents as needed, in order to complete tasks for a user.

Agent K is a modular, self-evolving AGI system that gradually builds its own mind as you challenge it to complete tasks.

The "K" stands kernel, meaning small core. The aim is for AgentK to be the minimum set of agents and tools necessary for it to bootstrap itself and then grow its own mind.

AgentK's mind is made up of:

1. Agents who collaborate to solve problems, and;
2. Tools which those agents are able to use to interact with the outside world.

It develops both of these as regular python files (in the `agents` and `tools` directories) so it's very easy to track its progress, and even contribute yourself if you want.

## The agents that make up the kernel

- **Hermes**: The orchestrator that interacts with humans to understand goals, manage the creation and assignment of tasks, and coordinate the activities of other agents.
- **AgentSmith**: The architect responsible for creating and maintaining other agents. AgentSmith ensures agents are equipped with the necessary tools and tests their functionality.
- **ToolMaker**: The developer of tools within the system, ToolMaker creates and refines the tools that agents need to perform their tasks, ensuring that the system remains flexible and well-equipped.
- **WebResearcher**: The knowledge gatherer, WebResearcher performs in-depth online research to provide the system with up-to-date information, allowing agents to make informed decisions and execute tasks effectively.

## Internals

AgentK is encouraged to write tests for itself. More can be done to aid with the detection and fixing of missbehaving agents and tools - this is work in progress.

AgentK is built on top of the excellent LangGraph and LangChain frameworks.

## How to run

AgentK runs isolated in a docker container, so you need the latest docker installed on your system.

1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
2. Set environment variables in `.env`
3. Run `./agentk`
